I have no con's for this one as they haven't given me, personally, any bad side effects. Colpermin capsules - peppermint oil capsules. They have helped me when cramping and occasionally constipated. However, too many of these have caused me to have severe diarrhoea, so you have to figure out how many work for you. They do also make absolutely everything minty, including your derriere on the way out. Windeze capsules - I believe they help to disperse the bubbles of trapped wind, which cause bloating and discomfort. Again, I haven't had any bad reactions to these personally, but I don't take them religiously, just when I'm desperate for relief. Lactulose liquid - This is a laxative type product. It is a sweet, syrupy liquid that you have about 15ml of. I have found it to be the gentlest of all the laxative product I have tried myself. There are others like Laxido sachets, Movicol sachets etc, which you mix with water and drink. I personally found these too harsh and they just gave me more pain. Rennie's - Again, I haven't used this one religiously, but occasionally they will help take the edge off if you've got terrible heartburn alongside the cramps and pain. If you are taking other medication, always speak to a pharmacist before taking any extra medication, even over the counter meds, in case of interactions. These may or may not work for you, they are just a few I have tried that have helped me personally. IBS can be incredibly debilitating so I am incredibly sympathetic to your struggle with it. The biggest thing I have done to help with my IBS is switch to a Low Fodmap diet, so that is also something I recommend looking into if IBS is affecting your quality of life. It's not for the faint of heart, but I have found it extremely beneficial. I sincerely hope you find some relief Gemima (P.S. sorry this was so long)" },  { "pais": "United Kingdom", "contenido": "Hi I recently saw some tablets on line called Wild Dose, I have dreadful IBS that I was beginning to believe would hinder everything I loved doing in my life due to my digestive issues.

I managed, without much difficulty, to taper to 6.5 mg a few weeks ago (I previously reduced to 7mg 11 months ago but increased the dose after aches and pains started creeping in, and started a slower taper). Recently, after a couple of weeks on 6.5, I started to feel a bit unwell (stiff neck and shoulders, achy, generally feeling under the weather). Taking 2 paracetamol seems to alleviate the symptoms a bit, so can this still be PMR pain if I get a bit of relief from Paracetamol?

When I started a slower tapering as I got lower that seemed to stop the problem. Would also say a couple of weeks into new dose is about normal time for body to realise not quite enough Pred - so although paracetamol may have given ‘a little relief’ - I’d still be thinking -is it a flare? As you also say at this level, adrenals are stuttering….so that adds in another element to consider. Sorry to say, it seems a bit of a ‘suck it and see’ problem …not sure we can give a simple solution.

A referral to a rheumatology physiotherapist for assessment and appropriate exercises or advice on movement would also be highly recommended. If this isn't helping you need to request a referral to a musculoskeletal specialist to check that it isn't a condition that may require treatment or steroids. If they don't find the issue is mechanical request them to refer you on to Rheumatology for assessment for other inflammatory or neurological joint issues that can cause similar symptoms like Inflammatory/ Reactive Arthritis, PMR or Fibromyalgia, trapped nerves etc. Keep a log of your pain and symptoms each day to show at appointments to help them make a diagnosis.

Also, here is the reduction schedule from RLS-UK. Scroll to Useful Resources. Once off Pramipexole and on replacement meds, you can then discuss safely replacing the other trigger meds with your doctor." }, { "pais": "United States", "contenido": "Welcome to the forum. You will find lots of help, support and understanding here. You are taking all kinds of medicines that will make your RLS worse as you said. Omeprazole can be replaced with gaviscon advanced which you can buy on Amazon. All statins make RLS worse. Nexlizet (Nustendi (UK) is a cholesterol lowering drug that is not a statin, but I don’t know if it exacerbates RLS symptoms. Ezetimibe (Zetia) reduces cholesterol although it doesn't reduce cholesterol as fast as the statins, but according to Chris Columbus it didn't trigger his RLS. And then there are Triglide (Fenofibrate, Fibricor, Lipantil, Lipofen, Supralip) and Bezafibrate (Bezalip) which are not statins which seem safe. You might want to discuss these with your doctor. A more difficult way to reduce cholesterol is to go vegan. My husband lowered his cholesterol from 221 to 131 this way. If you eventually take gabapentin or pregabalin you should be closely monitored as it can raise the bad LDL and lower the good HDL Amlodipine is a calcium channel blocker that makes RLS worse for many. Some medicines that are safe for high blood pressure are propranolol (Inderal, Hemangeol, InnoPran) a beta blocker that may help RLS, Isosorbide Mononitrate (Monoket, Imdur) which is not a beta blocker nor calcium channel blocker. Other possibilities are: Clonidine (Catapres) an Alpha-2-Agonist used to treat high blood pressure which may help RLS and which also treats insomnia, tenex (Guanfacine, Intuniv), prazosin (Minipress) an alpha-adrenergic blocker that is also useful in managing sleep-related problems caused by PTSD and Tadalafil a vasodilator that in one study completely eliminated RLS. Discuss these with your doctor. And then there is reducing salt by 1 teaspoon a day nih.gov/news-events/nih-res.... Finasteride is an interesting one. It is safe for RLS. It treats hair loss and benign prostatic hyperplasia in men. It can treats excessive hair growth in women.. is a 5a-reductase inhibitor and therefore an antiandrogen. Helps counter tendency to gambling addiction caused by pramipexole, the most common reported side effects are impotence and decreased libido. If you are taking it to help counter the tendency to gambling addiction caused by pramipexole then you definitely need to come of pramipexole. Tamsulosin can make RLS worse and you are already taking finasteride Now on to pramipexole. Up to 70% of people will eventually suffer augmentation according to the Mayo Clinic Updated Algorithm on RLS which believe me you don't want because it can be hell to come off it and the longer you are on it, the harder it will be to come off it and the more likely your dopamine receptors will be damaged so that the now first line treatment for RLS gabapentin or pregabalin won't work nor might iron. And one expert believes everyone will eventually suffer augmentation. The signs of augmentation are when you have to keep increasing your dose to get relief, or when your symptoms occur earlier in the day or there is a shorter period of rest or inactivity before symptoms start or when they move to other parts of your body (arms, trunk or face) or when the intensity of your symptoms worsen. The maximum amount of pramipexole is .5 mg. Even if you are not suffering from augmentation now, it would be a good idea to come off it now as it will only get worse and it will be easier to come off it while you aren't suffering augmentation. First off check if you are on the slow release pramipexole). The slow release ones usually have ER or XL after their name. If so you need to switch to the regular pramipexole because the slow releases ones can't be cut. To come off pramipexole, reduce by half of a .125 tablet every 2 weeks or so. You will have increased symptoms. You may need to reduce more slowly or with a smaller amount or you may be able to reduce more quickly. Wait until the increased symptoms from each reduction has settled before going to the next one. You will suffer and may need a low dose opioid temporarily to help out with the symptoms especially as you near the end. Some have used kratom or cannabis temporarily to help. But in the long run, you will be glad you came off it. Ropinirole and pramipexole are no longer the first-line treatment for RLS, gabapentin or pregabalin are. They used to be the first-line treatment which is why so many doctors prescribed it but they are not uptodate on the current treatment recommendations. (Pregabalin is more expensive than gabapentin in the US.) The beginning dose is usually 300 mg gabapentin (75 mg pregabalin) [If you are over 65 and susceptible to falls the beginning dose is 100 mg (50 mg pregabalin.)] Start it 3 weeks before you are off pramipexole although it won't be fully effective until you are off it for several weeks. After you are off pramipexole for several weeks increase it by 100 mg (25 mg pregabalin) every couple of days until you find the dose that works for you. Take it 1-2 hours before bedtime as the peak plasma level is 2 hours. If you need more than 600 mg take the extra 4 hours before bedtime as it is not as well absorbed above 600 mg. If you need more than 1200 mg, take the extra 6 hours before bedtime. (You don't need to split the doses with pregabalin) Most of the side effects will disappear after a few weeks and the few that don't will usually lessen. Those that remain are usually worth it for the elimination of the RLS symptoms. If you take magnesium even in a multivitamin, take it at least 3 hours before or after taking gabapentin (it is OK with pregabalin) as it will interfere with the absorption of gabapentin and if you take calcium don't take it within 2 hours for the same reason (not sure about pregabalin). According to the Mayo Clinic Updated Algorithm on RLS: 'Most RLS patients require 1200 to 1800 mg of gabapentin (200 to 300 mg pregabalin).' Have you had your ferritin checked? If so what was it? That is the first thing a doctor should have done. You want your ferritin to be over 100 as improving it to that helps 60% of people with RLS and in some cases completely eliminates their RLS and you want your transferrin saturation to be between 20 and 45. If not ask your doctor for a full iron panel. Stop taking any iron supplements including in a multivitamin 48 hours before the test, don't eat a heavy meat meal the night before and fast after midnight. Have your test in the morning before 9 am if possible. When you get the results, ask for your ferritin and transferrin saturation (TSAT) numbers. If your ferritin is less than 100 or your transferrin saturation is less than 20% ask for an iron infusion to quickly bring it up as this will help your withdrawal. If you can't get an infusion, let us know and we can advise you further." }, { "pais": "United States", "contenido": "Check out the Mayo Clinic Updated Algorithm on RLS which will tell you everything you want to know including about its treatment and refer your doctor to it if needed as many doctors do not know much about RLS or are not uptodate on it at Https://mayoclinicproceedings.org/a... Some things that can make RLS symptoms worse for some people are alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, sugar, artificial sweeteners, carbs, foods high in sodium(salt), foods that cause inflammation, ice cream, eating late at night, oestrogen (estrogen) including HRT, dehydration, MSG, collagen supplements, electrolyte imbalance, melatonin, stress and vigorous exercise. Some things that help some people include caffeine, moderate exercise, weighted blankets, compression socks, elastic bandages, masturbation, magnesium glycinate, fennel, low oxalate diet, selenium, 5 minute shower alternating 20 seconds cold water with 10 seconds hot water finishing with hot water for another couple of minutes, hot baths, distractions, CBD, applying a topical magnesium lotion or spray, doing a magnesium salts soak, vitamins B1, B3, B6, B12, C, D3, K2, if deficient, and potassium and copper if deficient, massage including using a massage gun, vibration devices like therapulse, using a standing desk, listening to music, meditation and yoga.

Therefore, there is no way of knowing whether the result is likely to be repeatable. There is also a question of ethics: did the 31 patients agree to have the recommended steroid treatment withheld for an unspecified period? Properly diagnosing patients with PMR involves ruling out other conditions first. So trying ibuprofen for a couple of weeks before deciding it's PMR would make sense.

It's so sad to hear things have become so gloomy just now and a few things leap out from your post. I wonder - has your liver disease been staged i.e. what degree of damage is there (cirrhosis ??). Sadly, in many cases liver disease can lead to fatigue and reversal of sleep/waking patterns. Do you see a liver specialist? and still have medical input. Although it seems somewhat contradictory but getting some exercise can often help to alleviate fatigue - it certainly raises your endorphin levels and this elevates your sense of well being. (I know that my hubby felt better for having exercise - particularly outdoors - than when he rested all day). Being in a home are you getting out and about at all? Even going out into the garden when you can to have a little walk up and down might give you a boost. Fatigue can also be nutrition related - are you getting enough fuel - eating a good balanced diet. You also sound like you've become more socially isolated too so if your mental health has taken a dip it will impact on the physical side of things. Maybe getting out of your room more and mixing might help lift your spirits. I guess at 80 years young some of your issues could be age related - bodies do slow down, some folks nap more. I guess you just want to live your best life possible. Does your home do trips out that you can go on? Do you see your son frequently? Is he able to take you out - even to the local park or for a change of scenery. It sounds very much like you need to be out of your room, getting more fresh air snd some gentle exercise or you will end up in a downwards spiral. Hopefully a few pointers there, yes they won't help your liver but might just make your days a bit brighter/happier.

I had “withdrawn” too from social situations cause I was just fed up of saying pardon all the time so I know just how isolating hearing loss can be.

It is making me wonder whether cold temperature has set this off.

I think also your bedding needs to be non allergenic, did you get that sorted out? Any pets at home? Have you been tested for pet allergies?

Those are just top of the head ideas, and i hope others here might also be able to make some suggestions.

There are some that target the allergic kind. in the meantime , it might be good to try and find out what your triggers are. Get yourself a steroid nasal spray prescription , lots of antihistamines, an air purifier and maybe change of bedding to target dust mites. For me personally I’ve found that layering on stress makes my asthma even worse, so trying to remain calm (which is hard when you’re sleep deprived). I also take 500mg quercetin / turmeric Curcumin extract with extra vitamin d3/ omega 3 supplements alongside asthma medication, and drink 2 litres of water a day to help with mucus removal. A PPI medication is also beneficial if you are known to have acid reflux that can also affect asthma and post nasal drip. I would try to discuss all of this with your gp if you haven’t already. It sounds like you meet all the criteria for biologics , so definitely try to push for that. Remember your health is priority.

Unfortunately you seem to have a Rheumy who bases too much emphasis on bloods and not symptoms… and is also so of the school that PMR shouldn’t last longer than around 2 years. This is a comment from a study - [full study linked for info] In a sizable proportion of PMR patients – from 7% to 22% – ESR is not raised at the time of diagnosis. However, in these patients, CRP is usually raised ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articl... As your initial levels were ESR - 34 [only just outside normal levels] CRP -22 would say you fall into that category. The fact that an increase help somewhat in December last year indicates you had reduced too quickly - and PMR was still very much alive. Stopping Pred in February was bad advice from consultant… Inflammations markers all the way through would have been within range because that’s what the job of the Pred is! .. so no point the consultant using that as a reason either. Your GP [if same one who diagnosed you initially] seems to be the answer… can I ask why you were referred to Rheumy - sounds as if you would have been better sticking with GP. Also agree with physio -,who seems to have a better understanding of PMR than Rheumy..

It certainly sounds like PMR to me! And most of us have found that symptoms trump blood tests - my Rheumatologist never looks at blood test results. Since it looks like your PMR was probably the result of a Vaccine, you may have a less aggressive type which may burn out quicker, nevertheless you have significant symptoms which were relieved by the Pred. and have now returned without it.

Background: I was always very healthy, no allergies at all, up until my early twenties when in 2017 I developed a problem with facial swelling and rash. It took about six months to poinpoint the issue, because all my NHS IgE tests were negative, so they misdiagnosed me with impetigo and gave me totally ineffective antibiotics for a while, as the rash got worse. Private blood testing of IgG and IgA from Cyrex labs suggested tapioca starch was the issue - I cut out tapioca and all of my symptoms *immediately* resolved, it was like magic. Note that I'm still IgE-negative to a tapioca allergy, but it's very clear when I eat it that I am severely intolerant (it takes about 36hrs for symptoms to appear).

At the end of the year, I was also diagnosed with osteoporosis, which was somewhat unexpected - I am only in my twenties and not underweight, nor have I ever been - but my periods were a bit irregular, so I put that as maybe being the cause.   2020 - The rash came back, along with the facial swelling. Except this time, it was worse, because the rash would appear absolutely anywhere on my body, and it was accompanied by intense episodes of uncontrollable sneezing, itchy eyes, sinus pain, etc, and then wheezing breathing. Based on my previous experiences with tapioca, I tried to figure out the allergen by cutting out foods - absolutely no success. 2021 - I retook the private blood testing from Cyrex labs and it was positive for intolerance to nearly everything - if I cut out all of these foods, I'd starve. I was doing a PhD at the time and decided that I would have to simply manage my symptoms because doing a long-term fast and trying to reintroduce foods one at a time simply wasn't feasible if I was going to get my academic work done. I went to various GPs and have the same problem Every Single Time: the GP completely ignores my history and what I'm actually telling them, and diagnoses me with whatever explains how I'm presenting in the room at the time. So, I have separate diagnoses for urticaria (the day I went in with a rash visible, but had taken piriton which worked on the sneezing), 'idiopathic' allergy to an unknown inhalant (the day I went in sneezing, but hydrocortisone had helped with the rash), and for asthma. And for the osteoporosis, which may or may not be part of it. Every time I tell them that all of the allergy-like symptoms all coincide with each other, all happen at the same time, and are all part of one larger issue - they just ignore me and focus on only one symptom.  When I did eventually get referred to a consultant immunologist (Dr James Laffan), he did the exact same thing as the GP and focused on the sneezing, giving me loads of IgE tests to inhaled substances, which were all negative. At the end of the appointment he said 'sounds like a mast cell disorder... I'll try referring you to a gastroenterologist.' He never actually made that referral, and annoyingly in his follow-up letter he diagnosed urticaria (which we had barely discussed at all) without mentioning mast cell disorder at all, but the mention led me to researching it, which has led me here.  He did at least recommend that I take fexofenadine and chlorphenamine which have really helped (in increasingly strong doses) for a long time, along with some hydrocortisone on the skin when needed. But - 2023 - I'm currently in a dreadful state, to be honest. The rash/hives have suddenly, in the last two weeks, gotten worse than ever before - and I really will soon not have any skin left on my hands in particular. It's never spread this fast before, and it itches and hurts unspeakably badly. Worst of all, my ultimate last resort - fasting completely - is not working. At the time of writing I haven't had anything except water in four days and the rash is STILL spreading to new areas and getting more severe (though fexofenadine etc is working on the other symptoms). I'm simply using ice packs and paracetamol to cope with the pain and itching. And trying different brands of bottled water in case that makes a difference(!). My GP gave me a 5-day course of steroids but made clear he won't make it a long-term prescription - so I'm saving it in case the rash gets worse on my face, which I'm now deadly terrified of. It's already around my lips. When the rash is on my face I have honestly no quality of life. Above all, I'm upset that through all these years of seeing so many doctors while getting steadily worse, and now at a point where I'm becoming genuinely disabled, mastocytosis and MCAS etc have all been known to exist, yet I've not been given a SINGLE diagnostic test except those [redacted] IgE tests, which are always negative, and seem to be used as a reason to dismiss me. I honestly suspect it works against me that I'm a young woman and cry very easily in appointments and 'look healthy' when I don't have the rash, that they decide immediately on seeing me that I'm an attention-seeker or just stressed. I've tried taking my husband with me but I don't seem to get much better treatment. I've been reading around this website for clinician recommendations - I've already tried to get in touch with Dr Alexandra Croom but apparently she's not taking on new patients, I've tried Dr Jose Costa and Dr Suranjith Seneviratne but not heard back yet, I'll see a dermatologist and a gastroenterologist from the Nuffield... has anyone else had diagnostic tests and/or competent care from any other doctors? Private or NHS - I'm genuinely so desperate at this point that I would even move house to be in the right postcode for a good doctor. Apologies it's a bit of a depressing post - and I don't even know for sure whether the issue is MCAS/mastocytosis etc because I've never had any tryptase (etc) testing.

Or just the soya yoghurts I ate ?", "pais": "United Kingdom", "topico": "I had my second of the latest duo of Rituximab infusions on Tuesday, three days ago. No reactions at the time at all and nothing to report on the one two weeks ago or indeed any of the others I've had since 2014. Just some increased upper respiratory infections from time to time. I can only think the reactions I've had are due to to the fact I ate two soya (Alpro) yoghurts earlier in the week (apparently soya makes you allergic if you are already allergic to peanuts, strawberries and shellfish .. two of which I never eat due to such severe allergies.) I look like I am an extra in Hammer House of Horrors, although the eyelid puffiness has calmed a little since starting antihistamines prescribed by the GP yesterday afternoon and the tapioca pudding type hives and the rashes on my arms chest and tum have calmed a bit too but still not gone. It's the eyes which are worrying me as I've never had a bag under my eye in my entire life. I have two puffy little under eye hives which haven't gone down and also eyelid swelling in general. There is some improvement since the photo was taken yesterday but I'm worried that it won't go. I've been prescribed Chlorphenamine Maleate 4mgs, max of four daily and have a week's supply. Anyone else ever had an allergic hives reaction to soya products whilst on Rituximab? I was worried that Rituximab has caused this reaction but my rheumy nurse phoned me and said it isn't that as it's never happened before and would have done the first of the recent duo, and didn't! However, the GP I saw yesterday says that Rituximab heightens histamine and then the fact I've had these two soya yoghurts this week has exacerbated the histamine levels in my body triggering the attack. It started exactly 24 hours after my infusion. Reading about soya allergy, apparently it can take a few days to appear as hives and this is exactly the way I had a reaction to prawns (pre RA many years ago.) Anyone else ever had similar re soya whilst on Rituximab? Note to self ... read ALL meds leaflets before having pharmacy and NEVER touch soya products .. not that I usually do but the yoghurts looked very nice!Sorry for the photo of my eyes ..

I am still suffering on the antipsychotic Haloperidol and wanted to share what a real mess I feel. So I was put Haloperidol depot that's an injection in hospital last year 2023 January. I was put under a lot of pressure from the psychiatrist and my family. Lots of ultimatums. That if I didn't stay on the meds that they would cut me off and my psychiatrist telling me that she would put me on a CTO community treatment order if I ever became ill again. A CTO is a court order forcing you to take medication against your will indefinitely. This is because I have had 7 breakdowns in 20 years. My son is 20 years old now. I still have birth trauma and terror of the thought of labour or having a little baby and that effected my ability to have a second baby which I regret terribly. I am not getting along with my NHS psychiatrist, she talks me down, dismisses anything I say and simply tells me I need meds for life. The problem is no matter what antipsychotic I'm given I always get serious insomnia. I have tried aripriprozole, risperidone, clonzapine, clopixal, Haloperidol, lithium and olanzipine. I get heavily sedated during the day and insomnia at night. I have survived on 4 hours of sleep for a year and managed to work though very tired. I am currently trying to cut down my meds with the help of a private psychiatrist. I've seen 2. But he proved complicated so I found a lady psychiatrist who suggested that I take one tablet and reduce it by a quarter each month but this too proved too much of an decrease for me. I was advised by the lady private psychiatrist that if I can't tolerate the greater reductions I should stick to reducing by tiny amounts. In the meantime I am due to see the NHS psychiatrist on Monday and she is not aware that I'm tapering with someone privately. I asked her for help in tapering and a second opinion and she refused both. She then reconsidered and suggested I reduce by two tablets. She seems to be sold on my staying on Haloperidol and will not try me on any new medicines. Our communication has broken down and because she's the lead consultant will not allow me to work with anyone else hence my currently also seeing the private psychiatrist. The private psychiatrist is gentle, kind and just what I need but the tapering I'm doing with her is not going well. I had to ring 111 last night because I literally haven't slept a wink in 3 nights I don't know why. This is dangerous for me and don't know what to do.

I feel its getting very confusing and would appreciate some advice from anyone who has had problems on their drugs or who has come off successfully. Hope you help with some honest advice.

Since pregabalin worked you might want try gabapentin. Although they are basically the same drug except you need to divide the doses, and the side effects are basically the same, some people find that the side effects that bother them on one don't bother them on the other. Pregabalin is more likely to cause weight gain. I only gained 2 pounds on gabapentin. Multiply the pregabalin amount by 6 to get the correct dose. If you need more than 600 mg take the extra 4 hours before bedtime as it is not as well absorbed above 600 mg. If you need more than 1200 mg, take the extra 6 hours before bedtime. If you take magnesium, even in a multivitamin, don't take it within 3 hours of the gabapentin as it reduces the absorption of the gabapentin. If you take calcium don't take it within 2 hours for the same reason. If you find you also gain weight on gabapentin, come off it slowly to avoid withdrawal effects as you probably did with the pregabalin although since you won't be on it as long it will be quicker. Another one to try is dipyridamole. You might want to discuss this with your doctor. It has helped some people on this forum and another forum I am on and has completely eliminated RLS in some. In the winter 2022 edition of Night Walkers, the publication of RLS.org there is an article by Sergi Ferre about dipyridamole discussing the effectiveness of it in a 2 week double blind placebo controlled study showing it completely ameliorated all symptoms. The study was by Dr. Garcia Borreguero movementdisorders.onlinelib... sciencedirect.com/science/a... Take it on an empty stomach. (fats inhibit absorption) about 1-1/2 to 2 hours before bed. If you have headaches they tend to disappear or lessen after around 5 days. The third possibilities is a low dose opioid although many doctors won't prescribe them. I would recommend buprenorphine or methadone as they are long lasting. Most of the others last only 4 to 6 hours and need to be taken that often or you will have mini withdrawals. If you are prescribed one of the others be sure you are given enough to take them that often" }, { "pais": "Australia", "contenido": "It seems your question is about sleep now. Compression or lower leg stimulation, avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine, consider medications that might exacerbate symptoms (SSRIs, SNRIs, neuroleptics, dopamine-blocking antiemetics) all have a reasonable level of science behind them. Makes sense to follow the science first. A lot of the other methods mentioned are anecdotal at best. Some swear by these others and to be fair it maybe the science simply has not done. I for one found hot baths and a wee choof to provide some relief, all be it somewhat short lived. Iorn levels do have science behind them, and it doesn't hurt to try, sounds like you've had the test and waiting for results, which is good because low and high iorn can point to other conditions which may be masked if you supplement it. In terms of iorn the strongest science suggests aiming for ferritin > 100 µg/L (some resources say 75 ug/L), and/or transferrin saturation > 20%." }]}

I am a 55y old male, doing rounds with various consultants to see why I have random joint pains primarily. I also have numbness and cold feeling in my extremities. My ANA and dsDNA are the ones that the Neuro picked up on and has referred me to Rheumatology as he thinks I have mCTD (lupus plus other presents). Anyway that trip is still to come. As part of my flare, I also lost the ability to fall and stay asleep. Initially my GP prescribed me Zopiclone which did the trick but that was for a total of 20 tablets. I practiced good sleep hygiene but was not really getting anywhere (around 3-4 hr every other day). After doing some research I found that there is a NICE approved insomnia drug (> 3month lack of sleep) called Daridorexant which is recommended for longer term use. I asked my GP for it and he was kind enough to push for it and got me a prescription. I have been using it for just over 3 weeks and it has worked somewhat for me in that I fall asleep and do get some sleep and mainly don't end up panicking about not having slept. I feel the sleep is not a really deep refreshing one but every little helps at this stage for me. So that is the tip that I wanted to share - please do your own research and don't be surprised if your GP has not heard of it - NICE approved in Sept 23' and also don't be surprised if your pharmacy can't get it - you may have to shop around.

Very hard to explain in what way but my logical side didn't function quickly... So I had to stop. I had to go back to my other sleep aids (magnesium supplement and L-theanine, red wine).

{ "titulo": "Cold Turkey Update", "pais": "Canada", "topico": "Some of you are familiar with my story so far so I will make this brief. Three years ago I was taking 6mg Pramepexole. It took me nearly three years to taper the dose down to 1.25. My idiotic Neurologist said he would no longer treat me unless I stoped taking Pramipexole. He writes my prescriptions for tramadol and that was what I was taking to control the RLS whilst tapering the Premipexole. I decided to take his advice. I took my last pramepexole nine weeks ago. (I can't even remember how to spell it!) It has been a terrible experience with nausea followed by anxiety/depression, chronic insomnia and RLS off the scale. I am very happy to say that I am starting to feel a little better. I wouldn't call it normal exactly, I think I forgot what that's like. If anyone out there is contemplating going cold turkey of a DA medication like Premipexole I would strongly advise against it. I have had severe RLS for many years but nothing in my experience comes close to the living hell I have been in for the last 9 weeks. I consider myself very lucky to be alive. I am now taking 150mg pregabalin and 7.5 mg zopiclone and300mg tramadol. Here are the questions I am now contemplating: 1). I am am taking 300mg of tramadol. Is this an unacceptably high dose? I have to wait another two weeks before I can get a referral to a different Neurologist and (hopefully) a prescription for Methadone or Buprenorphine (thank you all for your advice on this). 2) Am I going to be horribly addicted to tramadol? 3) Will I get my RLS back if I try to taper the dose? 4) Should I just stay at 300mg until I can transition to a better opioid? (3more weeks) 5) Would it be best to ask for Buprenorphine without the Nalaxone? I am still quite ill but the relief is huge and the thought of more suffering fills me with horror.

A common approach is to decrease the dose by 10-25% every 3-7 days. . A slower approach would be decreasing the dose by 10% to 25% every 1 to 3 weeks.

Naloxone is going to be in most formulations, mainly because the drug is primarily used to help with addiction and the naloxone lessens the ability to abuse it. I’ve heard that it reduces constipation, but didn’t find that to be the case for me. I have much less on the Butrans patch that has no naloxone than I did with Suboxone that includes it. Generally I would advise starting with the sublingual pills or strips. There is some adjustment period involved with finding the optimal dose, and the sublinguals allow you to tweak the dosage more easily. If the side effects still bother you after a month, then you might consider the patch. Most people have reduced side effects on it, mainly I believe because the dosage can be lower due to absorption differences." }, { "pais": "Canada", "contenido": "hey, you are doing great and glad you can feel some improvement.
